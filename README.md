Main Script: The main.py script is the primary program.

Calculation Mode (Parameter: num1):

num1=1: Calculates the ground state for a single omega value.

num1 > 1: Enables simultaneous calculations for multiple omega values.

Adaptive Sampling: The adaptive sampling.py script is used to implement the adaptive sampling method.

Initial Value: The 2d_0.pkl script is the suggested one to use for the zero-vortex initial value.

Instructions for Example 2.4: To run this example, simply execute the 2d script with num1 set to 1 and omega set to the specific value you wish to compute.
